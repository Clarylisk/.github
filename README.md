## Description
Clarylisk is a revolutionary Web3 donation platform built to protect content creators from gambling promotion. Our platform uses advanced AI to detect and filter gambling-related content in donation messages, allowing creators to either approve legitimate donations or burn those containing harmful promotions. All transactions are transparently recorded on the blockchain for complete verification and accountability.

## üõ† Problems Clarylisk Solves

### Online Gambling Promotion in Content Creation
Content creators frequently face unwanted gambling promotions disguised as donations. Clarylisk's AI-powered solution automatically flags and allows creators to burn donations containing gambling content.

### Donation Integrity and Transparency
Traditional donation platforms lack transparency regarding how creators handle problematic donations. Clarylisk's blockchain-based Approve/Burn system records all decisions permanently.

### Creator Accountability
Viewers and supporters have no way to verify if creators are actually rejecting gambling donations. Clarylisk's public donation tracker allows anyone to verify a creator's wallet history.

### Ethical Donation Management
When creators receive donations with gambling promotions, they often don't know what to do with the funds. Clarylisk's burn feature allows creators to publicly reject these donations through verifiable blockchain transactions.
